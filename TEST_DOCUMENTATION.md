## Test Phases Overview

The test suite consists of **14 comprehensive phases** that validate different aspects of the face recognition system:

### Phase 1: Folder Check and Dad Deletion
- **Purpose**: Validates saved_images folder structure and prepares for testing
- **Actions**: 
  - Checks for known/unknown person folders
  - Deletes existing "Dad" folders to prepare for transfer tests
  - Validates required persons (Mom, Daughter, Son) are present
  - Cleans up duplicate person folders

### Phase 2: Loading Known Faces
- **Purpose**: Tests loading faces from saved_images folder
- **Actions**:
  - Loads known faces with proper folder management
  - Validates no redundant folders are created
  - Reports loading statistics and errors

### Phase 3: Group Validation and Core Functions
- **Purpose**: Validates group states and core functionality
- **Actions**:
  - Tests known group functionality
  - Validates expected persons are loaded correctly
  - Tests training status functions
  - Ensures Dad is absent from known group

### Phase 4: Face Detection Core Functions
- **Purpose**: Tests basic face detection capabilities
- **Actions**:
  - Uses identification1.jpg for detection testing
  - Validates detection confidence levels
  - Expects 4 faces to be detected (Dad, Mom, Daughter, Son)

### Phase 5: Face Identification Functions
- **Purpose**: Tests face identification against known persons
- **Actions**:
  - Identifies known faces (Mom, Daughter, Son)
  - Detects unknown faces (Dad)
  - Validates identification accuracy

### Phase 6: Unknown Person Creation
- **Purpose**: Tests automatic unknown person creation
- **Actions**:
  - Processes frames with auto_add enabled
  - Creates unknown persons for unidentified faces
  - Validates background queue processing

### Phase 7: Transfer Mechanism Testing
- **Purpose**: Tests transfer from unknown to known group
- **Actions**:
  - Transfers first unknown person as "Dad"
  - Validates transfer queue processing
  - Confirms Dad appears in known group

### Phase 8: Final System Validation
- **Purpose**: Validates complete system state
- **Actions**:
  - Confirms all 4 persons (Mom, Daughter, Son, Dad) in known group
  - Tests training status
  - Validates face counts

### Phase 9: Dad Deletion Testing
- **Purpose**: Tests deletion from both group and server
- **Actions**:
  - Deletes Dad from known group
  - Removes Dad's folder
  - Validates complete removal

### Phase 10: Mom Server-Only Deletion
- **Purpose**: Tests server-only deletion (keeping folder)
- **Actions**:
  - Deletes Mom from server using direct API
  - Keeps Mom's folder intact
  - Triggers group retraining

### Phase 11: Re-identification Testing
- **Purpose**: Tests identification after deletions
- **Actions**:
  - Clears unknown group for fresh testing
  - Re-processes identification image
  - Expects 2 known (Daughter, Son) and 2 unknown (Mom, Dad)

### Phase 12: Similarity-Based Transfer
- **Purpose**: Tests intelligent transfer using image similarity
- **Actions**:
  - Uses Mom's saved images for similarity matching
  - Transfers matched unknown person as "Mom"
  - Transfers remaining unknown as "Dad"

### Phase 13: Final Complete Validation
- **Purpose**: Validates final system state with all persons
- **Actions**:
  - Confirms all 4 persons restored in known group
  - Validates empty unknown group
  - Tests complete folder structure

### Phase 14: Function Analysis
- **Purpose**: Analyzes codebase for function integrity
- **Actions**:
  - Checks for duplicate function definitions
  - Analyzes function overrides between classes

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. **Virtual Environment**: Ensure the project virtual environment is activated
2. **Environment Variables**: Set up Azure Face API credentials in `.env`
3. **Test Images**: Ensure `images/identification1.jpg` exists
4. **Saved Images**: Have face data in `face_recognition/saved_images/`

### Virtual Environment Activation

#### Windows
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd c:\Users\rony.thekkan\Python\FastRTC

# Activate virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Verify activation (should show .venv in prompt)
```

#### Alternative with UV
```bash
# Using UV to run directly
C:\Users\rony.thekkan\.local\bin\uv.exe run python tests/test_load_from_saved_images.py
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
copy .env.example .env

# Edit .env file and add:
# AZURE_FACE_API_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint_here
# AZURE_FACE_API_ACCOUNT_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Testing
```bash
# Run all tests with default settings (debug logging)
python tests/test_load_from_saved_images.py
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Run with minimal logging for production validation
python tests/test_load_from_saved_images.py --loglevel info
```

### Interactive Debugging
```bash
# Run with pause mode for step-by-step debugging
python tests/test_load_from_saved_images.py --pause
```

### Detailed Debugging
```bash
# Run with debug logging and pause mode
python tests/test_load_from_saved_images.py --loglevel debug --pause
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Run for automated testing (exits with proper codes)
python tests/test_load_from_saved_images.py --loglevel info
echo "Exit code: $?"
```

### Specific Phase Testing
The script doesn't support running individual phases, but you can:
1. Use `--pause` mode to stop at specific phases
2. Modify the script to skip phases for targeted testing
3. Use the detailed error output to focus on failing phases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Azure API Connection Errors
**Symptoms**: Phases 2-3 fail with API errors
**Solutions**:
- Verify `.env` file has correct Azure credentials
- Check internet connectivity
- Validate Azure Face API subscription status

#### 2. Missing Test Images
**Symptoms**: Phases 4-5 fail with "Image not found"
**Solutions**:
- Ensure `images/identification1.jpg` exists
- Check file permissions
- Verify image format is supported

#### 3. Folder Permission Issues
**Symptoms**: Phases 1, 9 fail with folder access errors
**Solutions**:
- Run with administrator privileges
- Check folder permissions on `face_recognition/saved_images/`
- Ensure no files are locked by other processes

#### 4. Function Definition Conflicts
**Symptoms**: Phase 14 fails with duplicate function errors
**Solutions**:
- Review the reported duplicate functions
- Check for copy-paste errors in class files
- Ensure proper function overriding

### Debugging Strategies

#### 1. Use Pause Mode
```bash
python tests/test_load_from_saved_images.py --pause
```
- Allows inspection of system state between phases
- Useful for identifying where issues occur

#### 2. Enable Debug Logging
```bash
python tests/test_load_from_saved_images.py --loglevel debug
```
- Provides detailed operation logs
- Shows API calls and responses

#### 3. Check Error Summary
- Review the detailed error report at the end
- Focus on the first failing phase
- Use error messages to identify root causes

#### 4. Validate Prerequisites
- Confirm all required files exist
- Check environment variable setup
- Verify virtual environment activation

### Performance Considerations

#### Test Duration
- **Full test suite**: 5-10 minutes depending on API response times
- **With pause mode**: Variable (depends on user interaction)
- **Network dependent**: Azure API calls affect timing

#### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: Moderate (image processing and face data)
- **Network**: High (multiple Azure API calls)
- **Disk**: Low (temporary file operations)

### Integration with Development Workflow

#### Pre-commit Testing
```bash
# Quick validation before commits
python tests/test_load_from_saved_images.py --loglevel info
```

#### Feature Development
```bash
# Interactive testing during development
python tests/test_load_from_saved_images.py --pause
```

#### Continuous Integration
```bash
# Automated testing in CI/CD
python tests/test_load_from_saved_images.py --loglevel info
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "All tests passed"
else
    echo "Tests failed - check logs"
    exit 1
fi
```
